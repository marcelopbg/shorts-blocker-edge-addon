Hide YouTube Shorts banners from home and subscription YouTube pages. Also, remove the Shorts menu item from the home page.

You can toggle or untoggle the blocker instantaneously and it'll take effect immediately in your active tabâ€”no need to refresh the page.

You can still actively browse your favorite creator's Shorts through their channels.

The code is open source, so feel free to contribute, clone, raise issues, or just look at it as needed.
