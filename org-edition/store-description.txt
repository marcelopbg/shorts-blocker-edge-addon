Shorts Blocker (Org Edition) is a streamlined browser extension that automatically blocks YouTube Shorts with no user interface or toggle.

This makes it ideal for schools, organizations, or managed deployments. This edition is perfect for environments where policy-based control is required and user interaction should be minimized.
